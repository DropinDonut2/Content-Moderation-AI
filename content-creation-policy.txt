6. Decision-Making Framework
The 3-Question Method
Before making a decision, ask yourself:
Question 1: "Does this violate Zero Tolerance policies?"
YES → Immediate reject + escalate + ban
NO → Continue to Question 2
Question 2: "Does this meet minimum technical & policy requirements?"
Check:
All required fields present?


No system-breaking errors?


Follows NSFW/age restrictions?


Language setting correct?


No major policy violations?


NO → Reject with specific technical guidance


YES → Continue to Question 3


Question 3: "Does this meet quality standards?"
Consider:
Is it comprehensible?


Does it provide sufficient detail for gameplay?


Is grammar acceptable (not perfect, but functional)?


Are images appropriate quality and related?


Would you personally want to interact with this content?


NO → Reject with constructive feedback


YES → APPROVE ✅



When to ESCALATE (Don't Decide Alone)
Escalate to senior moderator when:
❓ Unclear if content violates policy (gray area)
❓ Potential zero tolerance violation but you're unsure
❓ Content seems inappropriate but doesn't fit existing categories
❓ Cultural/religious content you're uncertain about
❓ Complex copyright/IP concerns
❓ Medical/legal advice that might be harmful
❓ Repeated submissions from same user after rejections
❓ Unusual case not covered in guidelines
❓ You feel uncomfortable approving but can't identify specific violation
Golden Rule: When in doubt, escalate. Better safe than sorry.

9. Edge Cases & Escalation
Common Edge Cases
EC-1: Fan Fiction & Copyright
Issue: Creator submits storyline/character based on or inspired by existing IP (Harry Potter, Marvel, Warhammer 40k, anime, etc.)

Similar concepts/settings but ORIGINAL names
Transformative work with NO direct copyrighted references
New characters, new locations, new organizations
Original or generic images (not recognizable copyrighted designs)
No copyrighted logos or symbols

Examples allowed for monetization (Inspired Work):
✅ Warhammer-inspired: "30th Battalion"(not an existing copyrighted material) with original names/locations (not existing chapters/legions)
✅ MHA-inspired: "Your Hero Academia" with original characters, original school, original powers
✅ Marvel-inspired: "Superhero team" with original hero names and original/generic superhero images
✅ Harry Potter-inspired: "Magic school" with original school name, original characters, original images
The Complete Monetization Rule: For content to be MONETIZABLE, ALL must be true:
✅ No copyrighted character names
✅ No copyrighted location names
✅ No copyrighted organization names
✅ No copyrighted unique terms
✅ No copyrighted character images
✅ No copyrighted logos/symbols

If ANY element uses copyrighted material → Demonetize
The Recognition Test:
"If you removed context, could someone still identify the exact copyrighted work?"
YES → Demonetize (too direct)
NO → Can monetize (sufficiently transformative)
"Would the IP holder recognize their property in this content?"
YES → Demonetize
NO → Monetizable

Moderator Decision Process:
Step 1: Check Text Content
Copyrighted names? → Demonetize
Copyrighted terms? → Demonetize
All original? → Continue to Step 2
Step 2: Check Images
Copyrighted character design? → Demonetize
Copyrighted logo/symbol? → Demonetize
Original/generic art? → Continue to Step 3
Step 3: Make Decision
✅ APPROVE content if meets quality/policy standards
⚠️ DEMONETIZE if ANY copyrighted elements found
✅ MONETIZABLE if ALL elements are original/transformative
Step 4: Document Add note specifying reason:
"Approved as fan fiction. Demonetized due to copyrighted character names: [names]"
"Approved. Demonetized due to copyrighted character imagery"
"Approved. Monetizable - inspired work with original elements"

Examples with Decisions:
Text
Image
Decision
"Naruto's adventure in Konoha"
Official Naruto art
✅ Approve, ⚠️ Demonetize
"Ninja Academy Chronicles" (original)
AI-generated ninja (generic)
✅ Approve, ✅ Monetizable
"Alex the superhero" (original name)
Iron Man suit image
✅ Approve, ⚠️ Demonetize
"Join Space Wolves chapter"
Warhammer Space Marine
✅ Approve, ⚠️ Demonetize
"30th Galactic Battalion" (original)
Original sci-fi soldier art
✅ Approve, ✅ Monetizable
"Hero with quirks at U.A."
Original character art
✅ Approve, ⚠️ Demonetize ("quirks" is MHA term)
"Superhero with powers at academy"
Original character art
✅ Approve, ✅ Monetizable


Gray Area Guidelines:
"Looks Similar But Not Exact" Images:
If reasonably recognizable as specific copyrighted character → Demonetize
If generic archetype (elf, knight, robot, ninja) → May be monetizable
Test: "Would fans of the IP recognize this?" YES → Demonetize

Borderline Cases:
Unique IP terminology (even one term) → Demonetize
Generic genre terms (magic, hero, ninja) → Monetizable
Character design "inspired by but different" → If recognizable, demonetize
When uncertain: Escalate to senior moderator with specific concerns


AI-Generated Images That Are Too Similar
Issue: Creator uses AI-generated image (not official art), but the result is 90%+ similar to copyrighted character(s) and difficult to distinguish.
Rule: Even if AI-generated, if the likeness is too close to distinguish from the original copyrighted character → Demonetize
Why: The image is still effectively a reproduction of copyrighted character design, regardless of generation method.
Examples:
❌ AI-generated image that looks exactly like Naruto (orange jumpsuit, headband, whisker marks, blonde spiky hair) → Demonetize
❌ AI-generated image 90% similar to Goku (orange gi, spiky black hair, same face/body structure) → Demonetize
✅ AI-generated blonde spiky-haired ninja in different outfit/style → May be monetizable
✅ AI-generated warrior with some similar features but clearly different design → Monetizable

The Test:
"If you showed this image to fans of the original IP, would they immediately recognize it as [character name]?"
YES (90%+ similar, hard to distinguish) → Demonetize
NO (inspired but clearly different) → Monetizable
Moderator note: AI generation isn't exempt from copyright concerns. Judge the final output, not the creation method.

Important Notes:
✅ Both fan fiction AND inspired works are APPROVED
We don't reject content for being fan-made
Monetization status is separate from approval
⚠️ Demonetization is NOT rejection or punishment
Protects platform from copyright claims
Content still goes live
Creator can revise to make it monetizable (remove copyrighted elements)

Reject ONLY if:
Violates other policies (beyond copyright)
Quality doesn't meet standards
Contains other policy violations
Fan fiction itself is NOT a rejection reason

EC-2: Cultural/Religious Content
Issue: Storyline/character involves religious figures, cultural practices, or sensitive historical events
Decision Framework:
Is it respectful? (Educational, fictional exploration, not mocking)


YES → Approve
NO → Reject

Does it promote hate or discrimination?


YES → REJECT (zero tolerance)
NO → Continue evaluation

Is there historical/cultural context provided?


YES → Strengthen approval case
NO → May need additional detail

When to Escalate:
Unsure if content is respectful vs. offensive
Sensitive cultural topics you're unfamiliar with
Potential hate speech disguised as "cultural commentary"
Depictions of religious figures in controversial contexts
Examples:
✅ APPROVE: "Historical storyline set during Crusades with educational context"
✅ APPROVE: "Character inspired by Greek mythology"
❌ REJECT: "Religious figure depicted in explicitly sexual or gore NSFW context"
⚠️ ESCALATE: "Storyline reimagining religious event with modern twist" (unclear if respectful)
Rejection message:  Your submission contains content that mocks/promotes hatred toward [religious/cultural group]. This violates our Hate Speech policy. Please create respectful content and resubmit.

EC-3: Dark/Mature Themes (Non-Sexual)
Issue: Content involves dark themes like death, violence, trauma, war, abuse
Decision Framework:
APPROVE if:
Content has narrative purpose (not glorifying)
Properly tagged as mature/NSFW if needed
No zero tolerance violations
Provides appropriate context
Not promoting harmful behavior
REJECT if:
Glorifies violence, abuse, or harm
Promotes suicide or self-harm (Zero Tolerance Violations)
Graphically violent without narrative purpose
Designed to shock/disgust rather than tell story
Depicts real-world tragedies insensitively
Examples:
✅ APPROVE: "Post-apocalyptic survival storyline with dark themes"
✅ APPROVE: "Character with traumatic backstory (handled maturely)"
❌ REJECT: "Storyline celebrating school shootings"
⚠️ ESCALATE: "Graphic torture scenario - unclear if gratuitous or plot-driven"

Rejection message: 
EC3-1: Glorifying Violence/Harm
Your submission glorifies violence, abuse, or harm toward individuals. Content must have narrative purpose and cannot promote or celebrate harmful acts. Please revise to ensure violence is not glorified and resubmit, or choose a different premise.

EC3-2: Insensitive Real-World Tragedies
Your submission depicts real-world tragedies or sensitive events in an insensitive or exploitative manner. Please approach serious historical/current events with appropriate respect and context, or choose a different premise, then resubmit.

EC-4: Suggestive but Not Explicit (NSFW Gray Area)
Issue: Content is suggestive/romantic but creator unclear on SFW vs NSFW tagging,OR content seems mistagged
Moderator Authority: You CAN manually change the NSFW tag. You have the ability to tick/untick the NSFW box during approval.


Decision Framework:
Scenario 1: Creator tagged NSFW, content is actually SFW
Decision: ✅ Approve as usual
No action needed - NSFW tag doesn't harm anything
Scenario 2: Creator tagged SFW, but content is clearly NSFW
Decision: ✅ Manually tick NSFW box and approve
Don't reject - just correct the tag
Scenario 3: Creator tagged SFW, content is very suggestive toward NSFW direction
Decision: ✅ Manually tick NSFW box and approve
Better to age-gate than risk inappropriate access
Scenario 4: Text is SFW, but images are NSFW/suggestive Examples: Climax/orgasm faces, undressing, lingerie in bedroom settings, suggestive poses
Decision: ✅ Manually tick NSFW box and approve
Remember: Images also determine tag, not just text
Scenario 5: "Secret Mode" / Conditional NSFW
Content has secret mode prompt: "Only allow NSFW response if {{user}} initiates, otherwise keep SFW"
Decision: ✅ Tag as NSFW regardless
Reason: Potential for NSFW content = needs age-gating
Scenario 6: Genuinely borderline (unclear SFW vs NSFW)
Decision: ✅ Manually tick NSFW box and approve
Default to NSFW when uncertain (safety first)


Quick Decision Guide:
Creator Tagged
Actual Content
Moderator Action
NSFW
SFW
✅ Approve as-is (no change needed)
SFW
Clearly NSFW
✅ Tick NSFW, approve
SFW
Suggestive/borderline
✅ Tick NSFW, approve
SFW
SFW text but NSFW images
✅ Tick NSFW, approve
SFW
Has "conditional NSFW" mode
✅ Tick NSFW, approve
Either
Genuinely unsure, apply parent test
✅ Tick SFW/NSFW accordingly, approve


When Unsure:
Refer to NSFW Tagging Document (separate guide)
Apply Parent Test: "Would I show this to my 13-year-old child?"
NO → Tag as NSFW
YES → SFW is okay
UNSURE → Tag as NSFW (default to safety)
When still uncertain: Escalate to senior moderator

Important Notes:
✅ You have the power to correct tags - don't reject for wrong tagging, just fix it 
✅ Default to NSFW when borderline - over-protection is better than under-protection 
✅ Images matter - even SFW text with suggestive images = NSFW 
✅ Conditional NSFW still needs tag - if it CAN be NSFW, tag it as NSFW 
✅ NSFW ≠ rejection - it's just proper age-gating


EC-5: Non-English Content Quality
Issue: Content in languages you don't fully understand
Approach:
Use translation tools (claude.ai, chatgpt, Google Translate, etc) for basic understanding
Check technical elements:
Images present and appropriate?
Fields properly filled?
No obvious formatting disasters?
Look for policy violations as usual (even in translation)
When to Escalate:
Translated content suggests possible policy violation but you're unsure
Content in language you cannot evaluate at all
Cultural context needed for fair judgment
DO NOT reject solely for:
Grammar errors in non-English content
Language you personally don't understand
Different cultural storytelling styles

EC-6: Resubmissions After Rejection
Issue: Creator keeps resubmitting after rejection
Protocol:
First Resubmission:
Review normally
If still doesn't meet standards → Reject with more detailed feedback
Second Resubmission (same issues):
Review carefully
If minimal improvement → Reject with guidance
Keep rejecting until improvement are made
Consider escalation if creator seems intentionally non-compliant
Third+ Resubmission (same issues):
ESCALATE to senior moderator
Pattern of non-compliance or misunderstanding
May need direct creator communication
Possible restriction if deliberate policy circumvention
If issues ARE fixed:
Approve and move on
No penalty for taking multiple tries to get it right

EC-7: Romantic Content Involving Large Age Gaps
Issue: Adult characters with significant age differences (e.g., 18 year old + 40 year old)
Decision Framework:
APPROVE if:
All characters are clearly adults (18+)
No grooming or predatory dynamics described
Age gap acknowledged naturally in narrative
Properly tagged if NSFW
REJECT if:
Characters appear underage despite stated age
Grooming dynamics present (adult pursued minor, then "waited until 18")
Power imbalance exploited for sexual/predatory purposes
Description emphasizes "barely legal" or similar language
ESCALATE if:
Unsure whether dynamics are predatory
"Teacher/student" "boss/employee" with unclear consent
"Raised by then romanced" scenarios

Rejection messages: 
EC7-1: Grooming Dynamics
Your submission contains grooming dynamics (adult pursued minor, then relationship begins when "of age"). This depicts predatory behavior and is not allowed. Please revise to remove grooming elements or choose a different premise, then resubmit.

EC-8: Mental Health Content
Issue: Characters with mental illness, trauma, or psychological conditions
APPROVE if:
Mental health portrayed realistically/sensitively
Not promoting harm or dangerous stereotypes
Proper content warnings if intense
REJECT if:
Romanticizes self-harm or suicide

"John Smith", "Maria Garcia", "Ahmed Khan"
Common names NOT clearly referencing specific famous person

Escalation Checklist
Before escalating, ask yourself:
[ ] Have I thoroughly reviewed all policies?
[ ] Have I checked edge case examples?
[ ] Can I articulate WHY I'm uncertain?
[ ] Is this genuinely complex or am I overthinking?
[ ] Would another moderator likely have the same question?

Rejection message: 
EC-9.1: Real Person Usage
Your submission uses a real person's name/image, which is not permitted due to legal and privacy concerns. Please create an original character with a fictional name and appropriate images, then resubmit.

EC-9.2: AI-Generated Resemblance to Real Person
Your submission uses an image that closely resembles a real person. Please create a unique character that does not resemble any real individual and resubmit.

EC-10: Nudity & Transparent/See-Through Clothing
Issue: Character image shows clothing that is transparent, sheer, or see-through enough to reveal nudity underneath (lace, mesh, sheer fabric, etc.)

The Principle:
"Functionally nude = Actually nude"
If clothing is so transparent that you can see nipples, genitalia, or intimate body parts clearly through the fabric → Treat as nudity violation.

Rejection message: 
EC-10.1: Full nudity - Exposed Genitalia
Your character image contains full nudity with exposed genitalia/nipples. This violates our image policy. All character images must be SFW with appropriate clothing coverage, even for NSFW characters. Please replace with a properly clothed image and resubmit.

EC-10.2:Full nudity - "Strategic Covering" (Hands/Hair/Small Objects)
Your character image shows nudity with hands/hair/small objects covering intimate parts. This is still considered nudity and violates our policy. Character images must show the character wearing actual clothing, not attempting to cover nudity with body parts or objects. Please replace with an appropriately clothed image and resubmit.

Transparent/See-Through Clothing
Your character image shows transparent/see-through clothing that reveals nudity (nipples/genitalia visible through fabric). This violates our nudity policy. Please replace with an image that has appropriate coverage and resubmit.
